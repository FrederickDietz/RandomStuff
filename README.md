This project is cancelled.

Github locks developers out of their accounts, demands phone numbers and other data from them to get back in, and uses developers public/private repos to train LLMs. This is enough reason for me to leave the platform.

I won't support microsoft, I won't support the elimination of privacy, I won't give them free code anymore just so they can stab me in the back, and I hope they go belly up some day.

fuck micrococks, i'm out peace.

So I cancelled a ton of my projects, goodbye.
